## �🎯 Problem Statement

### **The Local Commerce Challenge**
Local commerce faces critical inefficiencies that hurt both customers and small businesses:

**For Customers:**
- 🔍 **Search Inefficiency**: "I need a phone charger" doesn't find relevant local stores
- 📍 **Location Blindness**: No way to know which nearby shops have specific products
- ⏰ **Wasted Time**: Multiple store visits only to find items out of stock
- 🗺️ **Navigation Gaps**: Finding products ≠ finding the actual store location

**For Small Merchants:**
- 📊 **Invisible Inventory**: Products sit unsold because customers can't discover them
- 📝 **Poor Product Descriptions**: Basic listings don't attract online searchers  
- 🔔 **Reactive Management**: Learn about stockouts after losing sales
- 📈 **Limited Business Intelligence**: No insights into customer search patterns

### **Our AI-Powered Solution**
StockSpot revolutionizes local commerce through **Agentic AI** systems that:
1. **Understand** natural language customer needs
2. **Enhance** merchant product visibility with AI-generated content
3. **Connect** customers to nearby inventory through semantic search
4. **Optimize** merchant operations with intelligent notifications

**Result**: A thriving local economy where customers find what they need instantly, and merchants maximize their sales potential.

## ⚡ Quick Demo (No Setup Required)
1. Visit [stock-spot.vercel.app](https://stock-spot.vercel.app)
2. **Register/Login** as either "Customer" or "Merchant" (required for search functionality)
3. Search: "teddy bear", "educational toys", or "toy car"
4. Allow location or select "Chennai" from dropdown
5. See AI-powered multi-step search in action
6. **For Merchants**: Experience AI inventory management features

**Note**: Without login, you can only view the map interface - search requires authentication.

## 🧠 Agentic AI Architecture

### **Core Agentic AI Workflows** 

#### **1. Search Intelligence Agent (3-Step Process)**
```
Natural Language Query → AI Refinement → Vector Embedding → TiDB Similarity Search
```
- **Moonshot AI** refines "something to charge phone" → "phone charger"
- **Vector generation** creates semantic embeddings 
- **TiDB VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE** finds similar products

#### **2. Product Enhancement Agent (4-Step Process)**  
```
Raw Product Data → AI Analysis → Content Generation → TiDB Storage
```
- Analyzes basic product info ("Ball, $25")
- **Moonshot AI** generates engaging descriptions
- Auto-suggests categories and optimizes content
- Stores enhanced data with vector embeddings in **TiDB Cloud**

#### **3. Notification Intelligence Agent (5-Step Process)**
```
Inventory Monitor → Threshold Analysis → AI Enhancement → Delivery → Analytics
```
- Automated stock level monitoring via **TiDB queries**
- Business rule evaluation (low/critical thresholds)
- **AI-generated actionable recommendations** for merchants
- Multi-channel notification delivery with tracking

## 🔗 TiDB Cloud + Vector Search Integration

### **Database Architecture**
- **TiDB Serverless**: Auto-scaling cloud database with vector capabilities
- **Vector Storage**: Products stored with 4D embeddings using `VECTOR(4)` type
- **Similarity Search**: `VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE()` for semantic product matching
- **Performance**: HNSW indexing with TiFlash replication for sub-second queries

### **Vector Search Implementation**
```sql
-- Semantic product search with location
SELECT p.name, p.price, m.shop_name,
       VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE(p.embedding, ?) AS similarity,
       (6371000 * ACOS(...)) AS distance_meters
FROM products p JOIN merchants m ON p.merchant_id = m.id
WHERE similarity < 0.5 AND distance_meters <= ?
ORDER BY similarity ASC, distance_meters ASC;
```

### **Data Flow Summary**
```
User Query → Moonshot AI (refinement) → Vector Generation → 
TiDB Vector Search → Geospatial Filtering → Ranked Results
```
