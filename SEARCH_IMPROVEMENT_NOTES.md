# Search Logic Improvement

## Issue Fixed
The product search was showing incorrect results in the "Exact Matches" section. When searching for "paint", it would show any product containing "paint" as a substring, including unrelated products.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **True Exact Matches**
Now only shows products where:
- Product name exactly equals the search term (e.g., "paint" = "paint")
- Product name starts with the search term followed by a space (e.g., "paint brush", "paint roller")
- Product category exactly matches the search term

**Examples for search "paint":**
- ✅ **Will match:** "Paint", "Paint Brush", "Paint Roller", products in "paint" category
- ❌ **Won't match:** "Wall Paint Remover", "Anti-paint coating" (these go to related products)

### 2. **Partial Matches** 
Products that contain the search term but aren't exact matches:
- Show in the "Related Products" section
- Include products with the term anywhere in name/description/category

### 3. **Semantic Matches**
Using AI embeddings to find semantically related products:
- Products that don't contain the exact term but are conceptually related
- Example: searching "paint" might find "brushes", "rollers", "canvas"

## Code Changes Made

### Backend (searchController.js)
```javascript
// OLD - Too broad exact matching
const searchConditions = allSearchTerms.map(() => 
  'LOWER(p.name) LIKE LOWER(?) OR LOWER(p.description) LIKE LOWER(?)'
).join(' OR ');
const searchParams = allSearchTerms.flatMap(term => [`%${term}%`, `%${term}%`]);

// NEW - True exact matching
const exactConditions = allSearchTerms.map(() => 
  '(LOWER(p.name) = LOWER(?) OR LOWER(p.name) LIKE LOWER(?) OR LOWER(p.category) = LOWER(?))'
).join(' OR ');
const exactParams = allSearchTerms.flatMap(term => [term, `${term} %`, term]);
```

### Three-Tier Search Strategy
1. **Exact Matches**: True exact or prefix matches
2. **Partial Matches**: Broader substring matches (moved to related products)
3. **Semantic Matches**: AI-powered related products

## Results Structure
```json
{
  "exactMatches": [...],      // Only true exact matches
  "relatedProducts": [...],   // Partial + semantic matches combined
  "results": [...],           // All results combined
  "searchType": "exact_and_related"
}
```

## Testing
To test the improved search:
1. Search for "paint" - should only show exact paint products
2. Search for "brush" - should only show exact brush products  
3. Check that partial matches appear in "Related Products" section

The frontend automatically displays exact matches in the green "🎯 Exact Matches" section and everything else in the related products section.
